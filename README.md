This repository contains simulation environments and Python code extending the Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) framework for robotic manipulation tasks.

Developed by Johnson Ofori Amanfo as part of an MPhil project at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana.

### Included Environments:
- üõ†Ô∏è HammeringRMA: Simulates impact-force control and resistance adaptation.
- üî© ScrewdriverRMA: Simulates torque-driven manipulation for screw-driving actions.

These environments were designed as enhancements to the CVPR 2024 paper *Rapid Motor Adaptation for Robotic Manipulator Arms* by Liang, Ellis, and Henriques.
